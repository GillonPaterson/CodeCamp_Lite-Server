*To Run* run `npm run dev`

## Cool Things:
- Simple Web App & allows a lot of ability to customise
- Can get a good grip with packages, using npm even git
- Could give them an API to hit and pull data from

## Not Cool Things:
- Cannot be done in Codehs: Requires Queens Set Up
- Would require more instructions
